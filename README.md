## KewkLW Season 10 enhancements

This fork's `feature/s10-planner-enhancements` branch adds the complete set of
KewkLW planner work on top of upstream HSPlanner `1.0.5`:

| Area | Changes in this fork |
|---|---|
| Spec, Incarnation, and Ether loadouts | Eight independent numbered slots for each allocation domain, with exact-slot creation, switching, reset boundaries, autosave, Profiles, imports, and schema-v2 share-code persistence |
| Incarnation limits and identity | Explicit Hero Level state; one Incarnation point per Hero Level; cap enforcement across clicks, completed paths, suggestions, patches, saves, and all eight loadouts; correct Character → Spec → Incarnation → Ether navigation and distinct brick/cosmic surfaces |
| Gear optimizer | Native selected-spell equipment search with rarity rules, optional attribute/stat/resistance minimums, progress, before/after comparison, and an explicit apply action |
| Upgrade advisor | Repaired **Scan for upgrades** targeting so it uses the configured damaging spell or the first supported allocated damaging spell |
| Season 10 skill rules | Complete prerequisite graph for all 24 classes and 48 class-specific trees: 264 constrained skills, 277 direct links, 13 two-parent gates, recursive descendant cleanup, and client-confirmed AND semantics |
| Skill interaction | Left-click allocation on spell icons, keyboard support, consistent locked/max/no-points behavior, accurate prerequisite text/connectors, and reliable names when hovering allocated skills |
| Skill layouts | Current Bard and Prophet placement corrections plus the screenshot-backed nine-skill Jötunn layout and its six prerequisite connectors |
| Build import and patching | Authenticated development-only JSON importer plus revision-checked, allow-listed in-place profile patches for Incarnation, Ether, and mercenary allocations |
| Frost Orb profile | Screenshot-transcribed Jötunn gear, 14 Pristine Sapphires, Tombstone runes, two 53-node Incarnation presets, two Ether presets, and the photographed 100-point Magister setup |
| Data and stat correctness | Affix stat-key repairs, effective-resistance display fixes, Incarnation/Ether view-identity corrections, offhand legality revalidation, and targeted regressions |
| Verification | ESLint, the TypeScript/Vite production build, Rust `cargo check`, 129 Vitest files / 1,104 tests, and the patch-helper tests pass |

See **[README-KEWK.md](README-KEWK.md)** for the cumulative, detailed record
of every added behavior, persistence rule, implementation boundary, imported
payload, known limitation, and verification result.

The upstream project overview, release links, installation instructions, and
general feature documentation remain below.

## Upstream HSPlanner

A desktop build planner for **Hero Siege** - a calculator for the talent tree, gear, stats, and skills.

</details>

Across every tab:

- [x] **Affixes** — add affixes by family, pick a tier, and drag roll sliders (item-granted skill ranks roll too)
- [x] **Custom stats** — free-text user-entered stats for things outside the data model
- [x] **Seasons** — Season 10 is the base data; later seasons are applied as patch layers on top
- [x] **Builds menu** — multiple saved builds, each with multiple profiles
- [x] **Share** — export the entire build to a compressed URL (lz-string), optionally via the web share service
- [x] **Update check** — opt-in update check via GitHub Releases

## How to install

1. Go to the [latest upstream release](https://github.com/HeroSiegePlanner/HSPlanner/releases/latest)
2. In the **Assets** section, pick the file for your OS:

| Platform | Asset |
|---|---|
| Windows | `HSPlanner-x64-setup.exe` |
| macOS | `HSPlanner-x64.dmg` |
| Debian / Ubuntu | `HSPlanner-amd64.deb` |
| Fedora / RHEL | `HSPlanner-x86_64.rpm` |
| Arch Linux | `hsplanner-bin-*.pkg.tar.zst` (`pacman -U`) |
| Other Linux | `HSPlanner-amd64.AppImage` |

---

## Runtime requirements (prebuilt app)

The app is self-contained — end users do not need Node or Rust installed.

| Platform | Required component |
|---|---|
| Windows 10/11 | WebView2 Runtime (preinstalled on Win11; the installer pulls it on Win10) |
| macOS 10.15+ | None — WebKit is built into the OS |
| Linux (x86_64) | `webkit2gtk-4.1`, `gtk3`, `libssl`, standard GTK runtime libraries |

---

## Development requirements

| Tool | Minimum version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** | 22.x LTS (CI builds on 22) | Frontend (Vite + React 19) |
| **npm** | 11.x | Package manager |
| **Rust toolchain** | `rustup` with `stable` (≥ 1.82) | Tauri engine |
| **Tauri prerequisites** | see below per OS | Linker, system libraries |

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KewkLW/HSPlanner.git
cd HSPlanner
npm install
npm run tauri:dev
```

### Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run tauri:dev` | Run the desktop app in dev mode |
| `npm run tauri:build` | Build the installers/binaries |
| `npm test` | Vitest suite |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run parity` | Rust ↔ TS calculation parity gate (run after touching `calc`) |
| `npm run import-build -- <payload.json> ["Build name"]` | Import a planner share-payload into the running development app |
| `npm run patch-build -- <patch.json>` | Revision-check and patch an existing development build profile |

### Development build import and patch

While the development app is running, a share-payload JSON file can be added to
its saved-build library without UI automation:

```bash
npm run import-build -- imports/example.json "My build name"
```

The importer is available only from the loopback interface in development mode,
uses the planner's normal validation and storage path, and deduplicates an
identical build.

An existing profile can be updated without creating a duplicate by using an
allow-listed patch request containing its exact build/profile IDs:

```bash
npm run patch-build -- imports/example.patch.json
```

The patch command performs a revision-checked dry run, updates the planner's
live store and saved profile together, and verifies the result again after the
autosave window. It currently accepts Incarnation/Ether loadout slots and
mercenary class/skill ranks; gear and other profile fields cannot be changed by
this endpoint. Requested node paths must be root-connected for the loaded
season. If changing the active Incarnation allocation invalidates an equipped
offhand, the command reports that legality-driven removal explicitly.

### Project schema

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `frontend/` | React app (not `src/`) |
| `engine/` | Rust / Tauri backend, where the calculations live |
| `data/` | JSON shared by the frontend (`@data`) and the engine (`build.rs`); base = Season 10 |

### Tauri — system prerequisites

**Windows**
- Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools (workload "Desktop development with C++")
- WebView2 Runtime (only needed on Win10; Win11 has it preinstalled)

**macOS**
- Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only for development purpose because game doesn't support macos.

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**
```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential curl wget file libxdo-dev \
  libssl-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
```

**Linux (Arch)**
```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed webkit2gtk-4.1 base-devel curl wget file openssl \
  appmenu-gtk-module libappindicator-gtk3 librsvg xdotool
```

## FAQ

**Q:** *Can i import my save file from game to planner?*

**A:** *No you can't. It is against the EULA/TOS.*
